go to the neurotopics folder and open ipython:
from scripts import load_roi_labels as lr
al = lr.atlas_labeler()
to get data from brodmann areas map as a numpy array:
data = al.load_atlas_roi_data('brodmann')
to get data from all documents for one region and the name of the region:
roi_peaks = data[1,:] 
region_name = al.ba_labels[1]
to get data from one study for all brodmann regions and the doi of that study:
study_rois = data[:,1]
doi_label = al.doi_labels[1]

to get doi labels:
doi_labels = al.doi_labels()
